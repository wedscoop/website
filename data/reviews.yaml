The energy of our wedding festival has been exhibited with the same pomp and splendor as it felt for all of us. Team is highly professional, unobtrusive on the field and has delivered the content right on time. Absolutely way more value for your money. Every second of the videos, and every candid capture brings back the excitement from the wedding and a nostalgic smile. Thank you team! You will go a long way!!!!"

    comment: "The Wedscoop team was extremely professional and at the same time very friendly. The one vendor in my entire wedding that everyone enquired about was the photographers; aka Wedscoop. In such a heavily packed wedding schedule, Saurabh made sure that all the beautiful moments are captured without me batting an eyelid for it. I would recommend them 100% to any potential enquiries."

    comment: "First of all, I don‚Äôt think the team needs any feedback, their work speaks for itself. Considering the times now, the photography for our wedding day was the most important aspect for me and my partner and we spent a lot of time looking for someone who had the same ideas as us. We‚Äôre so glad that we went ahead with Wedscoop. They captured all those precious moments from start to finish. The work is incredible and Saurabh's professionalism makes him worth every penny he cost. You won‚Äôt find a better wedding photographer!"

    comment: "We saw the work of Wedscoop on Instagram and reached out to Saurabh and in less than 3-4 hours the mandate relating to photography and videography for our wedding and related functions was given to Wedscoop. This is because not only is there work splendid but speaking to Saurabh was comforting that the Wedscoop folks know there craft, are courteous and will not try to pull a smart one. All through our discussions I got the feeling that they were concentrated and focussed on how to get the best photography and videography for our functions and not hung up just on the fee or unwarranted payment structures. At the functions too, my parents really loved the minimalistic interference these guys would have unlike the overbearing behaviour some photographers and there teams tend to have. Basically a lot of there photography becomes candid - these folks tend to let there actions speak rather than all words and no action. I cannot say enough about there professionalism, being at the top of there behaviour and more than anything letting people enjoy the functions and without becoming an impediment to natural feelings and emotions, preserving memories through splendid photos and videos. To sum it up, more than thee fees, it is the excitement and happiness of there client in seeing the photos and videos which drives Saurabh and Wedscoop and therefore by the end of it you end up with more than just a photography and videography team. Thank you very much again folks, it was a pleasure and see you soon for rest of the functions in my life ahead."

    comment: "Wedscoop team was our choice for our wedding shoot personally because of the choice of songs I had witnessed in their previous work related videos I saw online. They did absolute justice to the pictures and videos shot during my wedding. As candid as possible, followed every bit of instruction very closely and the best team we could‚Äôve hired for ourselves. WEDSCOOP and entire Saurabh‚Äôs team is definitely the one stop destination for all you people searching for quality work. Regards, Ishita and Achin #TEAMAI"

Most importantly, they give you result till you get satisfied. Highly cooperative when it comes to delivering the desired results.
